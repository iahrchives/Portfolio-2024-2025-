        <p style="font-size: 30px;">
          Technology has been a transformative force in my life. It has shaped how I learn, connect, and grow. Below are some of my reflections on its impact:
        </p>
        <ul style="font-size: 28px;">
          <li>💻 Technology as a Tool for Empowerment: From coding to designing, tech allows us to create and innovate in ways that were unimaginable before.</li>
          <li>🌐 Global Connectivity: The internet has turned the world into a smaller, more accessible place, enabling cultural exchange and collaboration.</li>
          <li>🧠 Continuous Adaptation: The fast pace of technological advancements pushes us to stay updated and adaptive to change.</li>
          <li>🔒 Ethics and Privacy: As tech evolves, it's essential to reflect on how we use it responsibly and protect our data and identities.</li>
          <li>📈 Personal Growth through Tech: Whether through self-improvement apps, online learning platforms, or digital creative tools, technology has been a catalyst for my development.</li>
